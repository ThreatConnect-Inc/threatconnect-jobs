# Jobs Contribution Guide

Contributing to the ThreatConnect Jobs Github repository is a powerful and scalable way to make a positive impact to the infosec community.

## Contributing Jobs

Jobs are stored in ThreatConnect-installable ZIP files, which allows them to be easily shared between instances of ThreatConnect.

In order to contribute a Jobs App, create a Pull request. To use the Jobs App in your instance, click the “Install App (+)” button in TC Exchange Settings (requires system administrator).

## Contribution Best Practices

**Give your Jobs App a descriptive name.** There may be dozens of Jobs Apps in an instance of ThreatConnect, so it's important that the name is notable and references key functions and/or integrations. For example, "Triage" is bad, "Email Triage" is better, "VirusTotal Email Triage" is awesome, and "VirusTotal Email Triage & Detonation - Host, Address, and Mutex Ingestion" is best.

**Include a description in the Jobs App.** Just like commenting in code, this helps other users better understand the purpose of your contribution and how to use it most effectively in their environment.
